# Multi Agent Personal Assistant

## Project Overview

`multiagent-assistant` is a multi-agent personal assistant prototype designed to run in a local Jupyter notebook or Python environment. Using AutoGen AgentChatâ€™s `SelectorGroupChat` framework, it:

- Breaks down complex natural-language user requests into discrete steps
- Delegates tasks like web research, summarization, email drafting, sentiment analysis, and meeting planning to specialized agents
- Ensures each agent invokes only the tools it needs (e.g., web search, saving drafts, adding toâ€‘dos, scheduling, logging)

This README explains how to clone, configure, and run the project, as well as export the agent configuration to JSON for AutoGen Studio.

> âš  **Note:** The AutoGen framework is under active development; APIs and agent behavior may change in future releases. Check the official AutoGen repository for the latest updates.

## Features

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Each task is encapsulated in its own `AssistantAgent`, making it easy to add or remove agents.
- **Tool Integration**: Built-in functions for web search (`perform_web_search`), email draft saving (`save_email_draft`), toâ€‘do list management (`add_todo_item`), calendar scheduling (`add_scheduled_event`), and event logging (`log_event`).
- **Smart Planning**: The `Intent_Task_Router` converts a cleaned user query into a step-by-step execution plan.
- **Flexible Termination**: Conversations end on the "TERMINATE" keyword or after a configurable maximum message count.
- **Interactive Input**: The `UserProxyAgent` can prompt the user for clarification when needed.

## Agents and Responsibilities

- **Orchestrator**: Receives the execution plan, delegates tasks to agents, and coordinates tool calls.
- **UserProxyAgent**:  Handles interactive prompts to gather missing information from the user.
- **Input\_Preprocessor**: Cleans and normalizes the raw user query, correcting grammar and extracting key entities.
- **Intent\_Task\_Router**: Analyzes the preprocessed query and generates a sequential plan listing which agent performs each step.
- **Web\_Search\_Agent**: Executes DuckDuckGo searches and returns raw results.
- **Summarization\_Agent**: Condenses provided text (e.g., into a bullet-point summary).
- **Scheduling\_Calendar\_Agent**: Simulates creating calendar events based on time preferences and attendees.
- **Email\_Composition\_Sentiment\_Agent**:
  - *ModeÂ 1*: Drafts the email body.
  - *ModeÂ 2*: Calls the tool to save the draft.
  - *ModeÂ 3*: Performs sentiment analysis on the draft text.
- **To\_Do\_List\_Agent**: Adds tasks to a toâ€‘do list file.
- **Clarification\_Agent**: Asks concise follow-up questions when required data is missing.
- **Analytics\_Logging\_Agent**: Logs events and tool results to a log file.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehmettgur/multiagent-assistant.git
cd multiagent-assistant
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Your OpenAI API Key Configure Your OpenAI API Key

The project supports two methods for providing your API key:

#### Via JSON config file (`your_api_key.json`)

```json
[
  {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  }
]
```

Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual key from OpenAI.

## Exporting to AutoGen Studio (JSON)

To load your agent configuration into AutoGen Studio, serialize the team to JSON:

```python
# After creating `team = SelectorGroupChat(...)` in your script:
team_component = team.dump_component()

# Pydantic v2+ method:
team_dict = team_component.model_dump(mode="json")
# Or for older versions:
# team_dict = team_component.dict()

import json
with open("orchestrated_team_config.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    json.dump(team_dict, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
```

You can then import `orchestrated_team_config.json` into AutoGen Studio for visualization and further editing.
